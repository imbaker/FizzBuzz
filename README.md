# FizzBuzz

## Introduction To The FizzBuzz game
Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.

Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "Fizz"
and any number divisible by five with the word "Buzz".

Any number divisible by both three and five is replaced with the word "FizzBuzz".


## The Problem
Simulate the FizzBuzz game by building a console app using a TDD approach. The solution should be able to simulate an incremental count of 1 to 100

## Acceptance Criteria
1)	Replace any number divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz"
2)	Replace any number divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz"
3)	Replace any number divisible by 3 and divisible by 5 with the word "FizzBuzz"
4)	All other numbers remain as is.
5)	The application should be able to handle numbers from 1 to 100 only

## What you have to do
Using the following structure:

* Class FizzBuzzTests.cs contains your unit tests
* Class FizzBuzz.cs contains the code that makes your tests pass
* Class Program.cs contains your main method that instantiates FizzBuzz()

1)	Write your first unit test and then write enough production code to make the test pass
2)	Extend the unit tests to cover all above acceptance criteria using a TDD approach (Red, Green, Refactor)
3)	Get the console application displaying the required output

## Explaining you Solution
You will be required to share your solution and give a brief overview of how you resolved the problem using a TDD approach and be able to answer specific questions about your design.
